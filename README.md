# tracker
Following along with Level Up's FullStack React with NextJS tutorial.
[tutorial](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/fullstack-react-with-nextjs/series-introduction)

## Concept
A habit tracker made using React and NextJS. 
Also using a mongo DB with an Apollo GraphQL Client. 
 
The tutorial uses the form library [fresh](https://github.com/leveluptuts/fresh) but I chose [Formik](https://github.com/formium/formik) instead.
 
## Goals
- [ ] Tutorial is about a year old and was released before NextJS v10, adobt new data fetching methods. 
- [ ] Complete the tutorial and then add my own tweaks to the design. 
- [ ] Expand functionality for my day to day.
- [ ] For styling, the tutorial uses [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx), once finished with the series migrate all styling to [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and add a theme provider.
- [ ] Add a Github Action to automatically bump and tag master, on merge, with the latest SemVer formatted version.
